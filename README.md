## Ideas for a definitive Asteroids

- Add a dificulty system (easy, normal, hard)
- Add a time system to increase the dificulty overtime
- Add a hard cap to prevent the game from getting too dificult
- Make the score have a multiplier for the dificulties
  
- Add lives to player
- Make the player lives be awarded overtime
- Make the lives have a hard cap of 3 or 5
- Make it so when the player dies all asteroids are destroyed, no point awarded, the player respawns if he has lives left, the dificulty based on time regresses a few minutes (slightly lowers the asteroid spawn dificulty) and after 5 seconds asteroids spawn again

- Points will be a double value that will be transformed into int for display in scoreboard
  
- Explore the possibility of making asteroids with more vertices in the random generator

- Make the asteroids have HP depending on the dificulty and/or time
- Make the asteroids be divisible when destroyed (destroy 1 and 2 come in its place having 1 hp)
  
- Implement a high score system with a way for the player to input 3 letters as an identifier, max amount of players on scoreboard: top 5? top 10?
- Make the high scores be saved when the game shutsdown (save a txt file somewhere in the machine? maybe just save a txt file in the game folder for simplicity and to allow for the high score to migrate PCs if in a removable disk)

- Make a control system (keyboard based, awd or arrows + SPACE for movement and shooting)

- Add a pause menu
- Add a help button for controls and an overview of the game (make the help button change the controls as the settings are changed)

- Add a button to hide the UI when playing the game (make TAB either toggle the UI or have it trigger the UI while pressed and make it disapper when TAB released, add a setting to do that)
